**Louis
what did you do yesterday : Created CastCard + CastSection + SimilarMovies
what are you going to do today: Add cast section cards scroll ability, connect movie cards from the homepage to route to their detailed views. Changing the trailer to open in a modal instead of playing directly on the page. 
any block/help from the team: Not yet  


**Shao Hang
what did you do yesterday : created Login.jsx, auth.js in services for all the post request and get request, AuthContext.js, modified the nav bar so you only see when you login.
what are you going to do today: Finish up the login features (with redirecting + login with username and password)
this can take up to 2 days until i make it work. After this, I can continue on my watchlist and favorite list.
any block/help from the team: No help, but I need to figure out the login redirecting since the login with juste the username and password is already implemented.
